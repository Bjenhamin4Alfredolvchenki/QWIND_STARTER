## Demo

ðŸ“Œ [https://qwind.pages.dev/](https://qwind.pages.dev/)

<br>

## Getting started

This project is using Qwik with [QwikCity](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/overview/). QwikCity is just a extra set of tools on top of Qwik to make it easier to build a full site, including directory-based routing, layouts, and more.

### Project structure

Inside **Qwind** template, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ adaptors/
|   â””â”€â”€ static/
|       â””â”€â”€ vite.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ robots.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ styles/
|   |       â””â”€â”€ global.css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ atoms/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ icons/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ widgets/
|   |       â”œâ”€â”€ Header.astro
|   |       â”œâ”€â”€ Footer.astro
|   |       â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   |   |   â”œâ”€â”€ post-slug-1.md
â”‚   |   |   â”œâ”€â”€ post-slug-2.md
â”‚   |   |   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx
|   |   â””-- service-worker.ts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.mjs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entry.dev.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entry.preview.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ entry.ssr.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ root.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

- `src/routes`: Provides the directory based routing, which can include a hierarchy of `layout.tsx` layout files, and an `index.tsx` file as the page. Additionally, `index.ts` files are endpoints. Please see the [routing docs](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/routing/overview/) for more info.

- `src/components`: Recommended directory for components.

- `public`: Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public directory. Please see the [Vite public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) for more info.

<br>

### Configuration

Basic configuration file: `./src/config.mjs`

```javascript
export const SITE = {
  name: "Example",

  origin: "https://example.com",
  basePathname: "/", // Change this if you need to deploy to Github Pages, for example
  trailingSlash: true, // Generate permalinks with or without "/" at the end
};
```

<br>

### Deploy

#### Deploy to production (manual)

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
npm run build
```

Now, your website is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at
`dist` folder, which you can deploy the folder to any hosting service you
prefer.
